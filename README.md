### My Hobbies
---
I like:
1. World War History
- Personally, I find something about the horrors of war interesting. I don't exactly know what led me to becoming interested, I just did. When I turned 14 specifically. Maybe boys just hardwired to be obssessed with war history once they turn 14. I usually study about the strategies and tactics used, the war crimes of each country, battles, timeline, and a bit about the guns and uniforms. **Battle of Berlin** and **Battle of Verdun** are my favorite battles of both world wars.
2. Physchological Horror
- Regular horror is there to spook you. Makes you run on adrenaline then you gives you one big scare to give you a heart attack or something, but that's about it. Getting scared over and over gets kind of boring and that's why I find this subgenre of horror interesting. It relies on *atmosphere*. Yeah, atmosphere, it's been said multiple times I know. However, being able to evoke specific feelings in someone is kind of a hard thing to do. Psychological horror focuses on manipulating your mental or emotional state, for spookiness. There's lots of factors to consider when making content using this type of horror. Audio, visuals, the graphics, lots of things. It messes with your head instead of just jumpscaring you and that's what I love about it.
3. Morbid Topics
- Morbid curiosity.
4. Rap Music
5. Video Gaming
