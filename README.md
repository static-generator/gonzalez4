### My Hobbies

I like:
1. World War History
- Personally, I find something about the horrors and chaos of war interesting; or does that sound a bit too edgy? I don't exactly know when or how I even got interested into this, I just did. When I turned 14 specifically. Are boys just hardwired to be obssessed with war history once they turn 14? Well, I wouldn't know.
2. Physchological Horror
- 
3. Morbid Topics
4. Rap Music
5. Video Gaming
